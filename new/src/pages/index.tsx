        self-teaching is difficult. Itâ€™s time to treat self-paced,

        Itâ€™s not for lack of effort. Itâ€™s not for lack of time. Itâ€™s not for
        lack of free learning resources. Instead, there are three major reasons
        why young people have struggle gaining momentum:

        Itâ€™s easy to forget{" "}

          how easy it is to get stuck when youâ€™re young
        </span>
        ; knowing where to find answers to questions, finding alternatives, or
        overcoming obstacles is a skill that develops with age.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        Young people need a lot of help, which we can provide in broken-down
        guides, direction from mentors, and the space to continuously expand
        into increasingly ambitious endeavors.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        Most importantly,{" "}

        The minority of content produced by Colossus members will be what they

      <h1 className={header}>Tangibility</h1>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        ðŸš¨ Itâ€™s hard if learning has little or infrequent real-world, hands-on
        application.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        ðŸš¨ It&apos;s hard if there isn&apos;t a strong reason &quot;why&quot;
        one is learning.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        Itâ€™s counterintuitive that resources, like KhanAcademy, MIT
        OpenCourseware, or Libgen, are{" "}
        <span className={highlight}>
          not often cited by builders as paths for self-learning
        </span>
        , given that they provide limitless, free, world-class education.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>Why is this? Tangibility. </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        This is easy to see if we take a look at non-digital, advanced subjects.
        Naturally, contribution and acknowledgement in high-depth subjects is
        very discrete: there is little contribution that a high schooler can
        progressively create in the field of mathematics.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        As a result, studying high-depth topics can be incredibly difficult, as
        progress can feel useless and intangible.{" "}
        <span className={highlight}>
          Most people arenâ€™t capable of self-studying math for years in hope of
          a distant payoff
        </span>
        , especially since institutional education will not recognize it.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        This outlines tangibility, which is akin to{" "}
        <span className={highlight}>
          changing learning from climbing a cliff into walking up stairs
        </span>
        , where reward can be found at each step.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        In software, this is common: students begin with building a personal
        website, feel proud of their creation, then iterate.{" "}
        <span className={highlight}>
          Contribution, creation, and impact can be created within hours
        </span>
        : results are tangible, not abstract.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        Whether itâ€™s web development, biology, or climate research, we can make
        progression more tangible.

        A community of similarly-paced peers can offer the feedback, criticism,
